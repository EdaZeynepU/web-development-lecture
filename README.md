Here is my single page website for my CENG 350 2023-2024 class.
I tried to make it responsive as possible as I can.
It is a website for a bank which has 
- **Exchange Rate Values:** The left section of the website displays real-time exchange rate values, allowing users to stay updated on currency conversions.

- **Bank Account Information:** On the right side, you'll find information about your financial situation and customer information.

- **Random Money Quotes:** Each time you open the website, a new money-related quote will be seen on the right top corner of the nav.

# Technologies Used
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
